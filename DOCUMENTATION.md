# üìö Project Documentation - Flask CI/CD Pipeline

## üéØ Project Overview

This document outlines the complete journey of building a containerized Flask web application with an automated CI/CD pipeline, including all challenges faced and solutions implemented.

## üìã Steps Followed

### Phase 1: Understanding & Local Testing (30 minutes)

#### What We Did:
1. **Analyzed the starter Flask application**
   - Simple Flask app with one endpoint returning "Hello from your containerized Flask app!"
   - Basic `requirements.txt` with Flask dependency

2. **Local Testing**
   - Installed Flask locally
   - Tested the application to ensure it works

#### Key Learning:
- Understanding the application structure before containerization
- Importance of testing locally first

### Phase 2: Containerization (45 minutes)

#### What We Did:
1. **Analyzed the Dockerfile**
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9-slim          # Lightweight Python base image
   WORKDIR /app                  # Set working directory
   COPY requirements.txt .       # Copy dependencies first (for caching)
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
   COPY app.py .                 # Copy application code
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]      # Command to run the app
   ```

2. **Built and tested Docker container locally**

#### Problems Faced & Solutions:

**Problem 1: Version Compatibility Issue**
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'url_quote' from 'werkzeug.urls'
```

**Root Cause:** Flask 2.1.0 was incompatible with the newer version of Werkzeug installed on the system.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `requirements.txt` to pin compatible versions:
  ```
  Flask==2.1.0
  Werkzeug==2.1.0
  ```

**Problem 2: Port Conflicts**
```
docker: Error response from daemon: Bind for 0.0.0.0:8080 failed: port is already allocated
```

**Solution:** 
- Used different ports for testing
- Implemented proper container cleanup commands

#### Key Learning:
- **Dependency Management**: Always pin specific versions in production
- **Docker Layer Caching**: Copy requirements.txt before application code for better caching
- **Port Management**: Always check for port conflicts and clean up containers

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (1.5 hours)

#### What We Did:
1. **Created GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
   - **Build Stage**: Build Docker image with commit SHA tagging
   - **Test Stage**: Automated testing of the containerized application
   - **Deploy Stage**: SSH-based deployment to cloud VM

2. **Implemented Security Best Practices**
   - Used GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
   - Conditional deployment (only on main branch)
   - Proper error handling and logging

#### Workflow Breakdown:

**Build and Test Job:**
```yaml
- Checkout code
- Set up Docker Buildx
- Build Docker image with SHA tagging
- Test container functionality
- Optional Docker Hub push
```

**Deploy Job:**
```yaml
- SSH into server
- Install Docker if not present
- Clone/pull latest code
- Build new image
- Deploy with zero-downtime strategy
- Verify deployment
```

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Automated Testing**: Container health checks
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Stop old, start new container
- **Rollback Capability**: Tagged images for easy rollback
- **Security**: SSH key-based authentication
- **Monitoring**: Deployment verification

### Phase 4: Infrastructure as Code (Bonus - 30 minutes)

#### What We Did:
1. **Created Terraform Configuration**
   - **VPC Setup**: Custom VPC with public subnet
   - **Security Groups**: Proper firewall rules (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
   - **EC2 Instance**: Ubuntu 22.04 with automated Docker installation
   - **Elastic IP**: Static IP for consistent access
   - **User Data Script**: Automated server setup

2. **Implemented Best Practices**
   - **Variables**: Configurable parameters
   - **Outputs**: Important information display
   - **Security**: Encrypted storage, proper IAM

#### Terraform Structure:
```
terraform/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf              # Main infrastructure configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf         # Input variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf          # Output values
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfvars.example  # Example configuration
```

## üö® Problems Faced & Solutions

### 1. Flask-Werkzeug Compatibility
**Problem:** Version mismatch causing import errors
**Solution:** Pinned compatible versions in requirements.txt
**Prevention:** Always use virtual environments and pin dependencies

### 2. Docker Port Conflicts
**Problem:** Ports already in use during testing
**Solution:** Dynamic port allocation and proper cleanup
**Prevention:** Use docker-compose for complex setups

### 3. GitHub Actions SSH Authentication
**Problem:** Secure deployment to cloud instances
**Solution:** SSH key-based authentication with GitHub Secrets
**Security:** Private keys stored as encrypted secrets

### 4. Zero-Downtime Deployment
**Problem:** Service interruption during updates
**Solution:** Container replacement strategy (stop old, start new)
**Enhancement:** Could implement blue-green deployment

### 5. Infrastructure Management
**Problem:** Manual server setup is error-prone
**Solution:** Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
**Benefits:** Reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure

## üîß Technical Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Technology Stack
- **Flask**: Lightweight, perfect for microservices
- **Docker**: Consistent deployment across environments
- **GitHub Actions**: Integrated with GitHub, free for public repos
